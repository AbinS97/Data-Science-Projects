# Data-Science-Projects
Some data science projects. 

In the Potential_Lender_Prediction project I created a neural network which predicts whether the lender pays off or charged off. The dataset used to create the 
neural network is  LendingClub dataset from Kaggle.com . The link for the dataset is provided in the notebook.
